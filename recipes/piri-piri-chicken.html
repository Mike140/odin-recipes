    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Piri-Piri or Frango Piri-Piri is a popular Portuguese dish.<br> 
    It’s simply a butterflied barbecued chicken served with fries and salad.<br> 
    What distinguishes the piri-piri chicken from other grilled chickens,<br> 
    is the chilli glaze it receives before going on the grill – the piri piri.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Small chicken butterflied – 1,3kg approximately</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves – minced</li>
        <li>30g butter – room temperature</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your chicken on a baking tray, 
            season it with the minced garlic and lemon juice. 
            Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine the butter and fresh thyme, then divide the mixture in half. 
            Add each half to under the skin of the chicken breasts. 
            Rubbing it from the outside to make sure the butter is well spread. 
            This will add extra flavour to the breasts and make them more moist. 
            Season the chicken with salt and black pepper, then set it aside.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven to 240 °C. Meanwhile, 
            add the piri-piri sauce ingredients to a food processor, 
            blend everything for a couple of minutes. 
            It should look like a smooth paste but not super liquid.</li>
        <li>Once the oven is hot, add the seasoned chicken. 
            Cook it for 20 minutes, then spread 1/3 of the piri-piri sauce over the whole chicken, 
            put it back in the oven. Repeat the process. 
            Continue roasting until the skin achieves a barbecued look.</li>
        <li>For the cooling sauce, finely chop your herbs, 
            combine them with Greek yoghurt and the ricotta. 
            Season it with salt, black pepper, and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Serve your chicken with the sides you prefer. 
            I served mine like the Portuguese do, with a simple salad, 
            French fries and, of course, the left over piri-piri sauce!</li>
    </ol>
