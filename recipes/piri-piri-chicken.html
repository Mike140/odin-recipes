    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Piri-Piri or Frango Piri-Piri is a popular Portuguese dish.<br> 
    It’s simply a butterflied barbecued chicken served with fries and salad.<br> 
    What distinguishes the piri-piri chicken from other grilled chickens,<br> 
    is the chilli glaze it receives before going on the grill – the piri piri.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Small chicken butterflied – 1,3kg approximately</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves – minced</li>
        <li>30g butter – room temperature</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your chicken on a baking tray, 
            season it with the minced garlic and lemon juice.<br> 
            Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine the butter and fresh thyme, then divide the mixture in half.<br>
            Add each half to under the skin of the chicken breasts.<br> 
            Rubbing it from the outside to make sure the butter is well spread.<br> 
            This will add extra flavour to the breasts and make them more moist.<br> 
            Season the chicken with salt and black pepper, then set it aside.</li>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven to 240 °C.<br> Meanwhile, add the piri-piri sauce ingredients to a food processor, 
            blend everything for a couple of minutes.<br> 
            It should look like a smooth paste but not super liquid.</li>
        <li>Once the oven is hot, add the seasoned chicken.<br> 
            Cook it for 20 minutes, then spread 1/3 of the piri-piri sauce over the whole chicken,<br> 
            put it back in the oven. Repeat the process.<br> 
            Continue roasting until the skin achieves a barbecued look.</li>
        <li>For the cooling sauce, finely chop your herbs,<br> 
            combine them with Greek yoghurt and the ricotta.<br> 
            Season it with salt, black pepper, and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Serve your chicken with the sides you prefer.<br> 
            I served mine like the Portuguese do, with a simple salad,<br> 
            French fries and, of course, the left over piri-piri sauce!</li>
    </ol>
