    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When it comes to chicken there just isn’t anything more delicious than a juicy,<br> 
        crusty piece of finger-licking good fried chicken. If you’ve ever wanted to make your own fried chicken,<br> 
        now is the time to try!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Buffalo Hot Sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce,<br> 
            salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces.<br> 
            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep.<br> 
            Heat to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder,<br> 
            garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika,<br> 
            and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture.<br> 
            Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly.<br> 
            Tap off the excess.</li>
        <li>Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time.<br> 
            The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible.<br> 
            Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through,<br> 
            until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. </li>
        <li>Remove from the oil and place on paper towels.<br> 
            Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
