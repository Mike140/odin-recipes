    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti alla carbonara. Luscious and wonderfully indulgent,<br> 
        pasta carbonara takes as long to make as it does to cook the pasta.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
        <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water with Salt</li>
        <li>While the water is coming to a boil,<br> 
            heat the olive oil or butter in a large saut√© pan over medium heat.<br> 
            Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.<br>
            Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute,<br>
            then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is al dente, use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic.<br> 
            Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.<br>
            Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot.<br> 
            It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste.<br> 
            Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.</li>
        <li>Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper.<br> 
            If you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
